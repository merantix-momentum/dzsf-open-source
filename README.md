## Introduction

This project is a collaboration between **Merantix Momentum** and the **Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Schienenverkehrsforschung beim Eisenbahn-Bundesamt** to enable a fully automated noise mapping process across the whole Germany. The goal of the project is to segment noise insulating wall from aerial imagery near railways. This repository contains the exported ONNX model file and documentation for our machine learning solution tailored for the detection of noise insulating walls from aerial imagery near railways. 

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on developing a machine learning solution to detect noise insulating walls from aerial imagery. We employ state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning to accurately identify these walls, which are crucial for various urban planning and environmental management applications.

## Model Architecture

Our model architecture is based on a vision transformer (DINOv2 base) backbone with register tokens with a segmentation head. The frozen backbone encodes the input image which is then processed by the segmentation head to generate pixel-wise predictions. The following diagram illustrates our model architecture:

## Training Data

Our model was trained on a dataset consisting of Orthophotos containing noise insulating walls covering the whole Germany. The Orthophotos had a ground resolution of `20 cm per pixel`. The annotations used for fine-tuning the segmentation head came in the form of linestrings which were then joined onto the raster layers and tiled togeter into `1000x1000 px` annotated images. 

## Key Features

- **Model Export**: Our solution provides the exported ONNX model file, ready to be used for inference.
- **Integration with QGIS**: Our solution seamlessly integrates with QGIS, enabling users to apply the trained model to their image data within the QGIS environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with using our model in QGIS, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Model**: Download the exported ONNX model file (`model.onnx`) from the [repository](model.onnx).
2. **Install QGIS**: If you haven't already, install QGIS on your machine. You can download it from the [official QGIS website](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).
3. **Install the Deepness plugin**: Install the [Deepness plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/deepness/) through QGIS.
3. **Load the Model in QGIS**: Open QGIS and load the `model.onnx` file into the Deepness plugin.
4. **Configure Parameters**: Set the required parameters, including image resolution and processing options.
5. **Load a Raster Layer**: Add a raster layer from an aerial image near the railways. 
6. **Run Inference**: Click "Run" to start the inference process and obtain segmentation results overlayed on the raster layer.
